Running Locally with Docker
To run this service locally with Docker, follow these steps:

Install Docker on your machine if you haven't already. You can download it from https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop.
Clone this repository to your local machine, link: https://github.com/NoaMila1/Autodesk-Home-Assignment.
Navigate to the directory of the cloned repository.
Build the Docker image by running docker build -t 'your-image-name' . Note: Don't forget the dot (.) at the end â€” painful experience :)
Run the Docker container by running docker run -p 3000:3000 your-image-name.
The service should now be running at http://localhost:3000.
Please note that you'll need to replace your-image-name with the actual name of your Docker image.
